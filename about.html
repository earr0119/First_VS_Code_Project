      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Many passions and technology is one of them. Currently a GenerationUSA
        student, studying and enjoying every moment I spend learning from an
        amazing professor and his TAs with amazing classmates. Aligning what I
        think with what I say and what I do. I enjoy contact with nature. I love
        music. I believe that we should enjoy everything we do, people normally
        run around and don't limit themselves for a moment to wondering, is this
        what I want for myself? Living the present!
